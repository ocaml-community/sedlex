# 3.2 (2023-06-28):
- Restore compatibility with OCaml 4.08
- Use `Sedlexing.{Utf8,Utf16}.from_gen` to initialize UTF8 (resp. UTF16) lexing buffers from
  string.
- Delay raising Malformed until actually reading the malformed part of the imput. (#140)
- Count lines in all cases (#130). Previously, certain functions for initiating the
  lexical buffer would disable lines counting.
- Check and fix invariants from Cset. The codebase was not respecting
  invariants documented in the Cset module which could break code
  relying on it. The code generated by sedlex.ppx could be affected.
- Do not rely on comments from unicode UCD files
- Add API to track position in bytes. Should be opt-in and backward compatible. (#146)

# 3.1:
- Fix directly nested sedlex matches (@smuenzel, PR #117, fixes: #12)
- Use explicit stdlib in generated code (@hhugo, PR #122, fixes: #115)
- Preserve location of lexbuf (@hhugo, PR #118, fixes: #19)
- Don't use gen to consume channels (@hhugo, PR #124, fixes: #45)
- New expect_test testsuite (@hhugo, PR #124)
- Properly recognize malformed truncated input (@hhugo, PR #124)
- Raise `Malformed` instead of `Invalid_arg` (@hhugo, PR #126, fixes: #91)
- Updated unicode support to `15.0.0`

# 3.0:
- Dropped `Stream` api which was removed in `4.14.0` ahead of the `5.0`
  release.

2.6:
