synopsis: "An OCaml lexer generator for Unicode"
description: """
sedlex is a lexer generator for OCaml. It is similar to ocamllex, but supports
Unicode. Unlike ocamllex, sedlex allows lexer specifications within regular
OCaml source files. Lexing specific constructs are provided via a ppx syntax
extension."""
